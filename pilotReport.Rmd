#### Methods summary: 

Study 1's key outcomes are the differences in participants' ratings of expected curiosity and interest in their "time capsule" items at Time 1 and their actual curiousity and interest at Time 2. Measures of predicted/actual curiosity and interest (a composite measure of surprise, meaningfulness, and interest) in viewing 9 time capsule items are taken at each time point respectively. T-tests are used to measure differences in mean curiosity and interest ratings (collapsed across the 9 items) across the two time points, and Time 1 means are subtracted from Time 2 means to capture participants' underestimate.

------

#### Target outcomes: 

Table 1 provides descriptive statistics for each measure for Study 1.
Participantsâ€™ Time 1 predictions of their curiosity (M = 3.99, SD = 1.32) were lower than their actual curiosity ratings at Time 2, immediately before reading their responses (M = 4.34, SD = 1.25), t(105) = 2.88, p = .005, d = 0.27. Participants also underestimated how interesting they would find their responses. Predictions of interest at Time 1 (M = 3.54, SD = 1.01) were lower than ratings of actual interest experienced at Time 2 (M = 3.82, SD = 0.89), t(105) = 3.10, p = .003, d = 0.29.

[PILOT/COPILOT DO NOT CHANGE THE CODE IN THE CHUNK BELOW]  

```{r global_options, include=FALSE}
# sets up some formatting options for the R Markdown document
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE)
```

# Step 1: Load packages and prepare report object

[PILOT/COPILOT Some useful packages are being loaded below. You can add any additional ones you might need too.]

```{r}
# load packages
library(tidyverse) # for data munging
library(knitr) # for kable table formating
library(haven) # import and export 'SPSS', 'Stata' and 'SAS' Files
library(readxl) # import excel files
library(ReproReports) # custom reporting functions
```

[PILOT/COPILOT DO NOT MAKE CHANGES TO THE CODE CHUNK BELOW]

```{r}
# Prepare report object. This will be updated automatically by the reproCheck function each time values are compared
reportObject <- data.frame(dummyRow = TRUE, reportedValue = NA, obtainedValue = NA, valueType = NA, percentageError = NA, comparisonOutcome = NA, eyeballCheck = NA)
```

# Step 2: Load data

```{r}
data <- read_sav("GroupC_2-10-2014/data/Study1_Data.sav")
```

# Step 3: Tidy data

```{r}
```

# Step 4: Run analysis

## Pre-processing

```{r}
```

## Descriptive statistics

```{r}
```

## Inferential statistics

```{r}
```

# Step 5: Conclusion

[Please include a text summary describing your findings. If this reproducibility check was a failure, you should note any suggestions as to what you think the likely cause(s) might be.]


[PILOT/COPILOT DOD NOT EDIT THE CODE CHUNK BELOW]

```{r}
reportObject <- reportObject %>%
  filter(dummyRow == FALSE) %>% # remove the dummy row
  select(-dummyRow) %>% # remove dummy row designation
  mutate(articleID = articleID) %>% # add variables to report 
  select(articleID, everything()) # make articleID first column

# decide on final outcome
if(any(reportObject$comparisonOutcome %in% c("MAJOR_ERROR", "DECISION_ERROR"))){
  finalOutcome <- "Failure"
}else{
  finalOutcome <- "Success"
}

# collate report extra details
reportExtras <- data.frame(articleID, pilotNames, copilotNames, pilotTTC, copilotTTC, pilotStartDate, copilotStartDate, completionDate, finalOutcome)

# save report objects
if(reportType == "pilot"){
  write_csv(reportObject, "pilotReportDetailed.csv")
  write_csv(reportExtras, "pilotReportExtras.csv")
}

if(reportType == "copilot"){
  write_csv(reportObject, "copilotReportDetailed.csv")
  write_csv(reportExtras, "copilotReportExtras.csv")
}
