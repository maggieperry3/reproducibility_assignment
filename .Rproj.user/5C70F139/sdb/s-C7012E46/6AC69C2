We targeted a recruitment of 130 to 150 students, anticipating a return rate of 60% to 70%.\n\n------\n\n#### Target outcomes: \n\nFor this article you should focus on the findings reported in the results section for Study 1 (and Table 1).\n\nSpecifically, you should attempt to reproduce all descriptive and inferential analyses reported in the text below and associated tables/figures:\n\nTable 1 provides descriptive statistics for each measure for Study 1.\n\nParticipants’ Time 1 predictions of their curiosity (M = 3.99, SD = 1.32) were lower than their actual curiosity ratings at Time 2, immediately before reading their responses (M = 4.34, SD = 1.25), t(105) = 2.88, p = .005, d = 0.27. Participants also underestimated how interesting they would find their responses. Predictions of interest at Time 1 (M = 3.54, SD = 1.01) were lower than ratings of actual interest experienced at Time 2 (M = 3.82, SD = 0.89), t(105) = 3.10, p = .003, d = 0.29.\n\n------\n\n[PILOT/COPILOT DO NOT CHANGE THE CODE IN THE CHUNK BELOW]  \n\n```{r global_options, include=FALSE}\n# sets up some formatting options for the R Markdown document\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE)\n```\n\n# Step 1: Load packages and prepare report object\n\n[PILOT/COPILOT Some useful packages are being loaded below.

The table presents results for the composite measure of interest as well as for the specific scales. For the measure of memory, participants indicated how much of their written summary of their conversation they expected to remember at Time 2 or they had remembered at Time 2.\n\n\nThis column presents p values from t tests comparing predictions with actual experience. --> which kind of t-test?

We therefore present results collapsed across the prompts.
