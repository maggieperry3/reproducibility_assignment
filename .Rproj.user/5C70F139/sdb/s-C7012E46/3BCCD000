Measures of predicted/actual curiosity and interest (a composite measure of surprise, meaningfulness, and interest) in viewing 9 time capsule items are taken at each time point respectively. T-tests are used to measure differences in mean curiosity and interest ratings (collapsed across the 9 items) across the two time points, and Time 1 means are subtracted from Time 2 means to capture participants' underestimate.\n\n------\n\n#### Target outcomes: \n\nTable 1 provides descriptive statistics for each measure for Study 1.\nParticipantsâ€™ Time 1 predictions of their curiosity (M = 3.99, SD = 1.32) were lower than their actual curiosity ratings at Time 2, immediately before reading their responses (M = 4.34, SD = 1.25), t(105) = 2.88, p = .005, d = 0.27. Participants also underestimated how interesting they would find their responses. Predictions of interest at Time 1 (M = 3.54, SD = 1.01) were lower than ratings of actual interest experienced at Time 2 (M = 3.82, SD = 0.89), t(105) = 3.10, p = .003, d = 0.29.  \n\n------\n\n[PILOT/COPILOT DO NOT CHANGE THE CODE IN THE CHUNK BELOW]  \n\n```{r global_options, include=FALSE}\n# sets up some formatting options for the R Markdown document\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE)\n```\n\n# Step 1: Load packages and prepare report object\n\n[PILOT/COPILOT Some useful packages are being loaded below.
